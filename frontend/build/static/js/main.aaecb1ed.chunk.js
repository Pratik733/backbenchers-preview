Arduino boards are able to read inputs - light on a sensor, a finger on a button, or a Twitter message - and turn it into an output - activating a motor, turning on an LED, publishing something online. You can tell your board what to do by sending a set of instructions to the microcontroller on the board. To do so you use the Arduino programming language (based on Wiring), and the Arduino Software (IDE), based on Processing."},{id:2,image:"https://ik.imagekit.io/lmsl6c7voys/graphic_nFbo6MoUG.gif?updatedAt=1629185898465",title:"Graphic Design",category:"Grade 9/Age 14-15",description:"Lot\u2019s many words but unless and until there's a proper pictorial representation for the same it\u2019s not worthyGraphic design is a craft where professionals create visual content to communicate messages.
